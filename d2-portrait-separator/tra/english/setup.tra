//Setup
@1 = ~Portrait Gender Separator~
@2 = ~~

@3 = ~NOTE: Portraits have been copied to the override.
I'd recommend to move or delete files beginning in M or F from the Portraits folder.~

@4 = ~The portraits in this folder and in the .LUA file are part of separate lists.
Both will appear when clicking through the portraits in the game if both exist.~
